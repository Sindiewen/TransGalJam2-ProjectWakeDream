  roomDescription: 'You put the dress on and gaze into the mirror in front of you.
    Suddenly you transform into someone completely different before your eyes. From
    your boyish look with short hair, your hair grows exponentially longer to your
    mid back, your figure is becoming more slender and refined, and your skin is clearning
    up. Your old look is replaced by a more feminine look.

    Both exits to the room slam closed.'
